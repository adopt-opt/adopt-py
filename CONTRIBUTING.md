# Contributing

To contribute code to the package, we follow the 'typical' Github workflow, which can be broken down into XX stages.

1. Forking the repository
2. Making changes to the code on your local fork
3. Run `.pre-commit` over your code to comply with formatting
4. Open a pull-request in the main repository describing your changes
    1. Address all comments, and requests for changes to your code
    2. Make sure all tests pass
5. Merge your code into the main repository
