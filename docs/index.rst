ADOPT: AI-Driven Design and Optimization
========================================

**ADOPT** is an open-source toolkit for the use of machine learning techniques, as well as classical
optimization algorithms for the optimization of designs in the context of scientific simulators, which
often bring theor whole own set of requirements. In addition, they are often only compatible with a
limited subset of machine learning, or optimization algorithms.


Core Features
-------------

* **Scalable** from laptop, to big clusters using `Ray <https://github.com/ray-project/ray>`_
* **Industry-Scale Optimization** across all scales with `Vizier <https://github.com/google/vizier>`_
* **Clean Core APIs** allowing for the easy integration of new simulators

.. note::

   This is early alpha-stage software, and there is no guarantee of stability whatsoever.
