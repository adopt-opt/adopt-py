# ðŸ¤–ðŸŒŠðŸš€ AI-Driven Design and Optimization (ADOPT)

## About

Python package for AI-driven design and optimization of scientific simulators building on

* [Ray](https://www.ray.io) for parallelization, [auto-scaling](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/cluster/getting-started.html), and [auto-tuning](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/tune/index.html)
* [Vizier Service](https://github.com/google/vizier) to keep track of the optimization configurations

Belied by a metadata system guaranteeing the physical correctness of configurations, and employing an SMT-solver to solve for allowed configurations of solvers, and optimization algorithms.
